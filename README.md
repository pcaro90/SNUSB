# SNUSB

## What?

A USB device based on the Nintendo SNES Gamepad hardware, emulating a partial
keyboard.

The original idea is to use it just as a gamepad for a SNES emulator. Later, it
may become something else.


## How?

Using a [Teensy 2.0](http://www.pjrc.com/), and interfacing with the gamepad
microcontroller. This idea was based on the
[YeOldeJoystick](https://github.com/johnburkert/YeOldeJoystick) project.
